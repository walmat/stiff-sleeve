        <h2 class="text-lg mb-3 font-medium title-font text-gray-900">Eligibility for Returns</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">To be eligible for a return or replacement, the sleeves or equipment must be in their original, unused, and unaltered condition, with no odor or signs of usage. Returns must be initiated within two weeks of the date you received the product.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg mb-3 font-medium title-font text-gray-900">Responsibility for Product Misuse</h2>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">While our sleeves are crafted from sturdy materials designed to withstand regular use, we are not responsible for any ripping or tearing due to inappropriate sizing selection. Please make sure to refer to our sizing guide and choose the appropriate size for your needs. <strong>Do NOT Size up.</strong> Due to the nature of the stiff neoprene, the best effect and advantage is received from a true to size fit, and not a sized down fit, as flexible neoprene sleeves provide.</p>
